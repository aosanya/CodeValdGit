# MVP - Minimum Viable Product Task Breakdown

## Task Overview
- **Objective**: Deliver a complete Go library that provides real Git semantics for artifact versioning in CodeValdCortex, replacing the custom `internal/git/` implementation
- **Success Criteria**: All 9 tasks (MVP-GIT-001 through MVP-GIT-009) implemented and tested; CodeValdCortex imports `github.com/aosanya/CodeValdGit`; legacy `internal/git/` deleted; ArangoDB Git collections (`git_objects`, `git_refs`, `repositories`) dropped
- **Dependencies**: Go module infrastructure, go-git v5, ArangoDB connectivity

## Platform Documentation
- **Requirements**: [requirements.md](../1-SoftwareRequirements/requirements.md) - Functional and non-functional requirements, scope, open questions
- **Architecture**: [architecture.md](../2-SoftwareDesignAndArchitecture/architecture.md) - Core design decisions, storage backends, branching model, proposed API

## Documentation Structure
- **High-Level Overview**: This file (`mvp.md`) provides task tables, priorities, dependencies, and brief descriptions
- **Detailed Specifications**: Each task with detailed requirements is documented in `mvp-details/{TASK_SPEC}.md`
- **Reference Pattern**: Tasks reference their detail files using the format `See: mvp-details/{spec}.md`

## Workflow Integration

### Task Management Process
1. **Task Assignment**: Pick tasks based on priority (P0 first) and dependencies
2. **Implementation**: Update "Status" column as work progresses (Not Started → In Progress → Testing → Complete)
3. **Completion Process** (MANDATORY):
   - Create detailed coding session document in `coding_sessions/` using format: `{TaskID}_{description}.md`
   - Add completed task to summary table in `mvp_done.md` with completion date
   - Remove completed task from this active `mvp.md` file
   - Update any dependent task references using notation: `~~MVP-GIT-XXX~~ ✅` (strikethrough + checkmark)
   - Merge feature branch to main
4. **Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite tasks are completed before starting dependent work

### Dependency Notation Convention
- **Active dependencies**: `MVP-GIT-XXX` (plain text)
- **Completed dependencies**: `~~MVP-GIT-XXX~~ ✅` (strikethrough + checkmark)
- **Multiple dependencies**: Comma-separated, e.g., `MVP-GIT-001, ~~MVP-GIT-002~~ ✅`
- **None**: Use `None` for tasks with no prerequisites

### Branch Management (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/MVP-GIT-XXX_description

# Work, build validation, test
# ... development work ...

# Merge when complete and tested
git checkout main
git merge feature/MVP-GIT-XXX_description --no-ff
git branch -d feature/MVP-GIT-XXX_description
```

## Status Legend
- ✅ **Completed** - Task done, merged to main (see `mvp_done.md`)
- 🚀 **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- 📋 **Not Started** - Ready to begin (dependencies met)
- ⏸️ **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies
- ⚠️ **Deprecated** - Superseded by other work

---

## P0: Foundation (CRITICAL)

*~~MVP-GIT-001~~ ✅ and ~~MVP-GIT-002~~ ✅ complete — see `mvp_done.md`.*

---

## P0: Core Operations (CRITICAL)

*Agent write primitives. Enables file-level work on isolated task branches.*

| Task ID | Title | Description | Status | Priority | Effort | Skills | Dependencies | Details |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|----------|--------|--------|--------------|---------|
| MVP-GIT-003 | Branch-Per-Task Workflow | Implement `CreateBranch(taskID)` → creates `refs/heads/task/{task-id}` from current `main` HEAD; `DeleteBranch(taskID)` → removes the branch ref. Agents must never commit directly to `main`. Returns `ErrBranchExists` / `ErrBranchNotFound` as appropriate. Both operations safe for concurrent callers | 🚀 In Progress | P0 | Low | Go, go-git | ~~MVP-GIT-001~~ ✅, ~~MVP-GIT-002~~ ✅ | [branch-workflow.md](mvp-details/branch-workflow.md#mvp-git-003--branch-per-task-workflow) |
| MVP-GIT-004 | File Operations & Commit Attribution | Implement `WriteFile` (commits any file type to a task branch with agent author + structured message), `ReadFile` (content at any ref: branch, tag, or SHA), `DeleteFile` (removes file as a commit), `ListDirectory` (immediate children at any ref). All writes include task ID in commit message | 📋 Not Started | P0 | Medium | Go, go-git | MVP-GIT-003 | [file-operations.md](mvp-details/file-operations.md) |

---

## P0: Merge Workflow (CRITICAL)

*Task completion pathway. Merges agent work back to `main`.*

| Task ID | Title | Description | Status | Priority | Effort | Skills | Dependencies | Details |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|----------|--------|--------|--------------|---------|
| MVP-GIT-005 | Fast-Forward Merge | Implement `MergeBranch` happy path: if `main` has not advanced since the task branch was created, perform a fast-forward merge using go-git's `FastForwardMerge` strategy (v5.12.0+). After merge, `main` HEAD points at the task branch tip | 📋 Not Started | P0 | Low | Go, go-git | MVP-GIT-004 | [branch-workflow.md](mvp-details/branch-workflow.md#mvp-git-005--fast-forward-merge) |
| MVP-GIT-006 | Auto-Rebase & Conflict Resolution | Implement `MergeBranch` fallback: when `main` has advanced, attempt auto-rebase by cherry-picking task branch commits onto latest `main` using go-git plumbing layer. On success → fast-forward merge. On content conflict → return `*ErrMergeConflict{TaskID, ConflictingFiles}` to caller; task branch left in clean state for agent retry | 📋 Not Started | P0 | High | Go, go-git | MVP-GIT-005 | [branch-workflow.md](mvp-details/branch-workflow.md#mvp-git-006--auto-rebase--conflict-resolution) |

---

## P1: History & Diff (IMPORTANT)

*Read access to historical state for the CodeValdCortex UI. Non-mutating operations.*

| Task ID | Title | Description | Status | Priority | Effort | Skills | Dependencies | Details |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|----------|--------|--------|--------------|---------|
| MVP-GIT-007 | History & Diff — UI Read Access | Implement `Log(ref, path)` → commits touching `path`, ordered newest-first; `Diff(fromRef, toRef)` → per-file changes with unified diff patch. All operations non-mutating and safe for concurrent access. Supports branch names, tag names, and full commit SHAs as refs | 📋 Not Started | P1 | Medium | Go, go-git | MVP-GIT-004 | [history-and-diff.md](mvp-details/history-and-diff.md) |

---

## P1: Storage & Integration (IMPORTANT)

*ArangoDB backend for container-restart persistence and final wiring into CodeValdCortex.*

| Task ID | Title | Description | Status | Priority | Effort | Skills | Dependencies | Details |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|----------|--------|--------|--------------|---------|
| MVP-GIT-008 | ArangoDB Storage Backend | Implement custom `storage.Storer` backed by ArangoDB: collections `git_objects` (blobs/trees/commits keyed by SHA), `git_refs` (branch & tag refs), `git_index` (staging area), `git_config` (per-repo config). Partitioned by `agencyID`. Working tree remains on local/in-memory `billy.Filesystem`. Repos survive container restarts without a PVC | 📋 Not Started | P1 | High | Go, go-git, ArangoDB | ~~MVP-GIT-001~~ ✅, ~~MVP-GIT-002~~ ✅ | [storage-backends.md](mvp-details/storage-backends.md) |
| MVP-GIT-009 | CodeValdCortex Integration | Add `github.com/aosanya/CodeValdGit` as Go module dependency in CodeValdCortex. Wire `RepoManager` into Agency and Task service constructors. Delete `internal/git/` packages (ops, storage, fileindex, models). Drop legacy ArangoDB Git collections (`git_objects`, `git_refs`, `repositories`). Full integration test suite passing | 📋 Not Started | P1 | Medium | Go, Backend Dev, Integration Testing | MVP-GIT-006, MVP-GIT-007, MVP-GIT-008 | [integration.md](mvp-details/integration.md) |
