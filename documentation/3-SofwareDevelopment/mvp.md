# MVP - Minimum Viable Product Task Breakdown

## Task Overview
- **Objective**: Deliver CodeValdGit as a standalone gRPC microservice that provides real Git semantics for artifact versioning in CodeValdCortex, replacing the custom `internal/git/` implementation. CodeValdCortex communicates via generated gRPC client stubs rather than importing CodeValdGit as a Go module.
- **Success Criteria**: All 10 tasks (MVP-GIT-001 through MVP-GIT-010) implemented and tested; CodeValdGit deployed as a standalone gRPC microservice; legacy `internal/git/` deleted from CodeValdCortex by a separate integration effort
- **Dependencies**: Go module infrastructure, go-git v5, ArangoDB connectivity

## Platform Documentation
- **Requirements**: [requirements.md](../1-SoftwareRequirements/requirements.md) - Functional and non-functional requirements, scope, open questions
- **Architecture**: [architecture.md](../2-SoftwareDesignAndArchitecture/architecture.md) - Core design decisions, storage backends, branching model, proposed API

## Documentation Structure
- **High-Level Overview**: This file (`mvp.md`) provides task tables, priorities, dependencies, and brief descriptions
- **Detailed Specifications**: Each task with detailed requirements is documented in `mvp-details/{TASK_SPEC}.md`
- **Reference Pattern**: Tasks reference their detail files using the format `See: mvp-details/{spec}.md`

## Workflow Integration

### Task Management Process
1. **Task Assignment**: Pick tasks based on priority (P0 first) and dependencies
2. **Implementation**: Update "Status" column as work progresses (Not Started → In Progress → Testing → Complete)
3. **Completion Process** (MANDATORY):
   - Create detailed coding session document in `coding_sessions/` using format: `{TaskID}_{description}.md`
   - Add completed task to summary table in `mvp_done.md` with completion date
   - Remove completed task from this active `mvp.md` file
   - Update any dependent task references using notation: `~~MVP-GIT-XXX~~ ✅` (strikethrough + checkmark)
   - Merge feature branch to main
4. **Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite tasks are completed before starting dependent work

### Dependency Notation Convention
- **Active dependencies**: `MVP-GIT-XXX` (plain text)
- **Completed dependencies**: `~~MVP-GIT-XXX~~ ✅` (strikethrough + checkmark)
- **Multiple dependencies**: Comma-separated, e.g., `MVP-GIT-001, ~~MVP-GIT-002~~ ✅`
- **None**: Use `None` for tasks with no prerequisites

### Branch Management (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/MVP-GIT-XXX_description

# Work, build validation, test
# ... development work ...

# Merge when complete and tested
git checkout main
git merge feature/MVP-GIT-XXX_description --no-ff
git branch -d feature/MVP-GIT-XXX_description
```

## Status Legend
- ✅ **Completed** - Task done, merged to main (see `mvp_done.md`)
- 🚀 **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- 📋 **Not Started** - Ready to begin (dependencies met)
- ⏸️ **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies
- ⚠️ **Deprecated** - Superseded by other work

## P3: CodeValdSharedLib Migration

*~~MVP-GIT-012~~ ✅ complete — see `mvp_done.md`.*

**MVP-GIT-012 scope** (completed 2026-03-02):
- Replace `internal/registrar/` with `github.com/aosanya/CodeValdSharedLib/registrar` (caller passes `"codevaldgit"`, its topics, and its `declaredRoutes`).
- Replace `envOrDefault` / `parseDuration` helpers in `cmd/server/main.go` with `serverutil.EnvOrDefault` / `serverutil.ParseDurationSeconds`.
- Replace the gRPC server setup block in `cmd/server/main.go` with `serverutil.NewGRPCServer()` + `serverutil.RunWithGracefulShutdown()`.
- Replace the ArangoDB `driverhttp.NewConnection` / auth / database bootstrap in `storage/arangodb/arangodb.go` with `arangoutil.Connect(ctx, cfg)`.
- Replace the local copy of `gen/go/codevaldcross/v1/` with the SharedLib copy; update `cmd/cross.go` and `internal/registrar/` import paths.
- Remove `internal/registrar/` package entirely.
- Update `go.mod` with `require github.com/aosanya/CodeValdSharedLib` and a `replace ../CodeValdSharedLib` directive.

See [CodeValdSharedLib mvp.md](../../../CodeValdSharedLib/documentation/3-SofwareDevelopment/mvp.md) for the full SharedLib task breakdown.
